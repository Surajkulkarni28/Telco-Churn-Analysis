In the telecom industry, customers are free to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecom industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many telecom service providers, retaining highly profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to understand customer behavior to determine the type of customers who are at high risk of churn.

In the project, I performed exploratory data analysis (descriptive analysis ) on telecom churn data to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of the churn.
